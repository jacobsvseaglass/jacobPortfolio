“Strata” is a unique and innovative Unreal 5 application that I created for my interactive and performance art client. “Topography” uses this technology and techniques in documentary film and interactive media to explore a set of overlapping philosophies of land-use in the area in a particular region in South Dakota in and around the Badlands National Park. Ultimately, this project will include a feature length documentary film, an installation at a major interactive festival, and series of performances, some of which are already underway.

As the prototype developer, I worked with project directors to create prototypes proving out the concept, visuals, and mechanics of the experience. I imported and optimized motion capture data and photogrammetry scans. I also developed custom shaders for environmental features and created several camera controllers that utilize a live-streaming toolkit. I built the user interface for performers to use, where they can select and customize key values and content elements in real-time.

In the latest phase, I collaborated with project directors to create prototypes for interactive technical installations adaptable for any setting or structure. I worked with Unreal virtual production tools allowing for real-time features in conjunction with needed assets and effects on the project to be conveyed in real-world spaces. I also designed tools for recording both media and audio outputs from Unreal for use in installations.
