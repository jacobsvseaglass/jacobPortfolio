Dimlight Dungeon is a 2D dark fantasy side scrolling brawler where the player controls a reptilian monster and travels within the ruins of a once mighty, heroic fortress. There the player must battle through rooms of knights to reach the final room and reclaim their lost land.

The team was made up of 13 people, and we built a custom C++ engine. In this project, I integrated the audio system FMOD studio and an input system into the custom C++ engine. Additionally, I engineered many gameplay mechanics including enemy behaviors. As a producer, I collaborated closely and supported each discipline to make sure expectations were met for every milestone.
