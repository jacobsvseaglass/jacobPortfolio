This unannounced project was a completed AI role-playing VR game prototype made for a major tech firm in Unity.

My main responsibility on this project was the procedural map generation, which required creating systems on both the company’s game server in JavaScript and the Unity client in C#. On the game server, I developed the map generator which handled creation of the maps from generated data in 2 different map scales. Using traditional procgen techniques combined with an AI generated art overlay API, this system created consistent maps that matched the desired gameplay and artistic goals of the prototype whenever a new procedural instance was made. I also dealt with storing the data in an accessible and compact fashion on the server. On the Unity Client, I programmed the functionalities to receive and display the data and handled the gameplay aspects of the map. I also created a tool in Unity to store and assign the relevant prototype’s art per each procedural instance. Finally, I created technical art and game transition states in regard to the map in game.
