“Metasites is a modular 3D internet framework built by XLA, that provides individual creators with the capacity to deploy their Unreal Engine-built content and connect it to the XLA ecosystem of features and services. The presentation revealed high fidelity graphics core experience, instant access to the system in the cloud through the browser, OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 integration powering non-active characters and their behavior, virtual assistant IVEE, ability to semantically analyze text and generate 3D scenes in UE5 and many other features.” – Alexey Savchenko, XLA Chief Product Office

On the project, my main focus was developing a custom Plugin in Unreal 5 to handle all the information between our company’s propriety event-driven distributed game server for asynchronous games and the XLA’s Unreal client. The plugin was engineered specifically to give tools to developers to access critical mechanics required for making and running different Metasites. I worked on the quest handler, game AI behavior (including conversations, spawning, movement, and actions), an abstract inventory manager, and player tracking. All of these features required work both on the plugin in Unreal C++ and blueprints, as well as network code on the game server.
